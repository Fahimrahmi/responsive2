                <h2 class="htwo"> How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey
                with the world.</p>
                <h2 class="htwo"> How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. Aftereach learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of
                what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
                others learn and stay motivated.</p>
